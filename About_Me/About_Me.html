      <h1>About Me and my Life at University of Waterloo</h1>
      <p>To start off my name is Allen Huang :) and I am currently studying Computer Engineering at the University of Waterloo. Usually I just do work ... but when I do have free time I like to play chess, Super Smash or table tennis. I also try to be active and do some swimming and play some badminton (two sports that I actually enjoy! :O). When I was younger I learned piano and played alot. Sadly, I don't play as much now, however I do like to sneak some playing time in during my week.</p>
      <p>Continuing! One thing that I really take interest in is technology. Mainly it's the software side, but hardware also intrigues me. Just like in reality these things always come in pairs; without software what would the point of hardware be? and vice versa. In the future I intend to have an occupation related to technology because I enjoy programming and being amazed by new advancements in technology. Hence, my field of study: Computer Engineering at the University of Waterloo. Ya! :D</p>
      <p>So far university life has been very busy and my schedule is always packed. I would like to say I get enough sleep, but in reality it just isn't happening. :( In the short time i've been here I have met so many awesome people, some from my program and others from my residence. Sometimes, I study with these people I am now lucky enough to call my friends, to alleviate the dullness of studying alone. Other times we just hang out and do things .... such as watch movies or play video games.</p>
      <p>Comparing university to high school I can confirm that what people say is TRUE! It is much more difficult and I have much more hours of school each day than in high school. The courses have been getting tough as well :( a lot of your success is based on how well can you can teach yourself, manage your time and how much effor your put in. I am glad to say that I am surviving and have passed all my courses thus far. \(^_^)/</p>
