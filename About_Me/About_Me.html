      <h1>About Me</h1>
      <p>My name is Allen Huang and I am a Computer Engineering student at the University of Waterloo. In my spare time I like to work on side projects and play video games. I am interested in several aspects of technology, for example machine learning and the numerous possibilities it holds for the future. Some games I enjoy playing are: World of Warcraft, Diablo, Starcraft, Age of Empires and Civilization.</p>
      <p>So far in my time at Waterloo I have had one co-op, this co-op was centered around research. I worked on used machine learning for prognostics of machines based on sensor data. I implemented several algorithms using machine learning and even created some of my own for progonostics. The machine learning models I most comfortable with are Hidden Markov Models and Multilayer Perceptrons, I used these for several of the different algorithms I implemented. I am also familar with fast fourier transfroms, short time fourier transforms, the SAX discretization method, extracting energies using wavelet packet decomposition, principle component analysis and various regression models.</p>
